  title: PowerPC 604e
  description: "The PowerPC is a Reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction
    set architecture (ISA) created by the 1991 Apple\u2013IBM\u2013Motorola alliance.
    The second generation was \"pure\" and includes the \"low end\" PowerPC 603 and
    \"high end\" PowerPC 604. The 603 is notable due to its very low cost and power
    consumption. Originally intended for personal computers, the architecture is
    well known for being used by Apple's Power Macintosh, PowerBook, iMac, iBook,
    and Xserve lines from 1994 until 2006."
