  title: Intel 80x86
  description: The 80486 was introduced in 1989 and was the first tightly pipelined
    x86 design as well as the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors,
    due to a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit. It represents
    a fourth generation of binary compatible CPUs since the original 8086 of 1978.
    This is the exposed die of an Intel 80486DX2 microprocessor that was launched
    in April 1989.
