  title: AMD Athlon Thunderbird
  description: AMD Athlon processor launched in 1999 and became the first CPU in
    the world to break the GHz barrier. AMD Athlon 64 was the first processor in
    the world to adopt the now-ubiquitous 64-bit architecture. The 64 X2 variant
    released in 2003 and was the first native dual-core desktop CPU. AMD saw a huge
    fall in its market mainly after Nvidia popularized switchable graphics in notebooks.
